your inkscape document must be x4 the maximum width and height of the drawing machine
also make sure to add a safety to drawing machine where maximum x and y can be set, just check at the bottom of the $$ menu, default i think is 200mm
last maximums i had on machine were 6.5mm and 6.5mm (ik weird)



follow every step in the description here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2349232

FOR universal gcode sender jar to run u must install java 7 otherwise u'll get random crashes during connection to the arduino

tip: if u're using the arduino cnc shield
pls reverse the pins in grbl library file
the step and direction pins are flipped
here C:\Users\kream\Documents\Arduino\libraries\grbl-servo-master\cpu_map\cpu_map_atmega328p.h

also servo angles must be changed at RC_SERVO_SHORT and RC_SERVO_LONG and RC_SERVO_INVERT
u gotta find the angle in terms of timer ticker just read the comments in the same line as those in the file
C:\Users\kream\Documents\Arduino\libraries\grbl-servo-master\spindle_control.c

the RC_SERVO_SHORT is the minimum value for the servo to be free to go into
the RC_SERVO_SHORT is the maximum value for the servo to be free to go into
and the range is 15 to 32, so choose ur values between these
i still have to use M3 S0 and M3 S180 to change pen positions idk why M3 and M5 don't work

1. 3d print the parts
2. don't screw the center top/bottom, just use black zipties
to keep them together
3. use 3mm screws everywhere u'll findem in boullonerie store
near dar el beida
4. get reverse springs that u have to pull btw, get MG90 for more
strength
5. connect only enable pins to Pin 8 arduino
6. u'll struggle to modify M05 servo's angle so
just use the python code called drawing_machine_servo_angles_updater.py
to replace the pen angles in resulting inkscape files
7. jsut use the inkscape preinstalled files that u keep inside this folder
u'll avoid errors that way
